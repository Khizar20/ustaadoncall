# UstaadOnCall - Comprehensive Fixes and Improvements

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements implemented in the UstaadOnCall application, including the original Google Maps CORS fix and subsequent authentication and user experience improvements.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Google Maps CORS Issues
- **Problem**: Google Maps API was blocked by CORS policy when called directly from the frontend
- **Solution**: Implemented a backend proxy (`backend/google_maps_proxy.py`) to handle Google Maps API calls
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 2. Authentication Issues
- **Problem**: 403 Forbidden errors when fetching user data from Supabase, "User not authenticated" errors in BecomeProvider form
- **Solution**: 
  - Added authentication checks in `BecomeProvider.tsx` with loading states and redirects
  - Improved error handling with specific messages for different authentication scenarios
  - Added proper authentication state management
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 3. Google Maps Marker Deprecation Warning
- **Problem**: `google.maps.Marker` is deprecated as of February 21st, 2024
- **Solution**: Updated `InteractiveGoogleMap.tsx` to use `google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement` with fallback to deprecated `Marker` only if `AdvancedMarkerElement` is not available
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 4. Translation Issues
- **Problem**: Missing translation keys for new error and loading messages
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive translation keys in `translations.ts` for all new messages in both English and Urdu
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 5. Email Verification Redirect Issues
- **Problem**: Email verification links redirected to landing page instead of login page
- **Solution**: 
  - Added email verification handling in `App.tsx` to detect verification tokens in URL
  - Automatically redirects to login page with success message after email verification
  - Updates user's `email_confirmed_at` in database
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 6. Duplicate Email Error Messages
- **Problem**: Generic error messages when users try to create accounts with existing emails
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved error handling in both `UserLogin.tsx` and `ProviderLogin.tsx`
  - Added specific error messages for different scenarios (invalid credentials, user not found, email not confirmed)
  - Better user experience with clear, actionable error messages
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 7. Development Options in Registration Success
- **Problem**: Registration success page showed "Register Another Account" and development options
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed development options and "Register Another Account" button
  - Cleaner success message focused on email verification
  - Simplified user flow with clear next steps
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 8. CNIC Input Field Removal
- **Problem**: CNIC number input field was added to the provider application form, but user requested to remove it as only CNIC images should be uploaded
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed CNIC number input field from `BecomeProvider.tsx`
  - Removed CNIC validation logic
  - Removed CNIC from formData state
  - Removed CNIC-related translation keys
  - Kept CNIC image upload functionality intact
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 9. Provider Application Database Schema Fix
- **Problem**: Provider application was trying to insert data into `providers` table with `about` field, but `about` column doesn't exist in `providers` table. Error: "Could not find the 'about' column of 'providers' in the schema cache"
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed insertion from `providers` table to `pending_requests` table
  - Updated data structure to match `pending_requests` schema
  - Changed `about` field to `bio` field to match `pending_requests` schema
  - Added `service_category` field with proper PostgreSQL array format
  - Service offerings now stored in `jobs_pricing` field of `pending_requests`
  - Updated navigation to redirect to user dashboard instead of provider dashboard
  - Updated success messages to reflect pending review status
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 10. Session Expiry Removal
- **Problem**: Users and providers were automatically logged out after 30 minutes of inactivity, which was not desired
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed all token expiry checks from authentication components
  - Removed periodic token expiry intervals
  - Updated login success messages to remove session expiry warnings
  - Updated provider dashboard settings to show "No expiry" instead of "30 minutes"
  - Updated translations to remove session expiry related messages
  - Users and providers now stay logged in until they manually log out
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 11. Provider Email and Phone Update
- **Problem**: The `providers` table was missing `email` and `phone` columns, and providers couldn't update their phone numbers in the profile update page
- **Solution**: 
  - Added SQL query to add `email` and `phone` columns to the `providers` table
  - Updated `backend/main.py` to include `email` and `phone` in the `ProviderIn` model and provider creation data
  - Updated `AdminPanel.tsx` to include `email` and `phone` in the `Provider` interface
  - Enhanced `ProviderProfileUpdate.tsx` to include phone number field with:
    - 11-character validation for Pakistani phone numbers
    - Placeholder "03xxxxxxxxx" format
    - Helper text explaining the format
    - Proper loading and saving of phone data
    - Database update functionality
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 12. Provider Services and Pricing Display Issue
- **Problem**: Provider services and pricing were not displaying correctly on the provider profile page. The `jobs_pricing` data structure was an object with job names as keys and prices as values, but the rendering logic expected an array of objects with `job` and `price` properties
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated the `Provider` interface to correctly reflect the data structure: `Record<string, Record<string, string | number>>`
  - Modified the rendering logic in `ProviderProfile.tsx` to handle the actual data structure:
    - Changed from expecting `services` as an array to handling it as an object
    - Updated the mapping logic to iterate over `Object.entries(services)` instead of `services.map()`
    - Created service objects with `job` and `price` properties from the key-value pairs
    - Updated `getStartingPrice` function to handle the new data structure
  - Updated `ProviderWithLocation` interface in `locationUtils.ts` to match the new data structure
  - Removed debug functions and console logs after identifying the issue
  - Maintained backward compatibility with string parsing for `jobs_pricing` if needed
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved
